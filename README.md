# Graphiter
Simple implementation demonstrating how to parse [BPFTrace](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace) files in a particular format and out put values to [Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/)

## Features

* Creates a bash file that can be used to start a bpftrace file and output data to a staging file called .staging.txt
* Creates a script file at /opt/graphiter/graphite.rb which will parse the staging file from above
* Creates a systemd service to allow graphiter to be ran as a service and constantly log to Graphite, every 15 seconds.
* Can easily be modified to support many other bpftrace files or any log file.
* Ruby and Python versions
* Utilises a simple Regex to find the bucket and value for each line output by the .bt file.
* Python version uses a module called graphyte which wraps some common use cases of sending data to graphite
* Ruby version simply opens a TCP connection to a host and port and sends data as expected
* Both versions can be passed environment variables to change the Graphite server to send to.
* Environment variables default to `localhost` and `2003`
* Provides a mechanism to deploy with Ansible, Puppet & Chef with examples of how to use each



# Installation/Deployment

## Puppet
You can also easily integrate Graphiter with your existing Puppet Deployments. Included in the repo is a simple Puppet Module called `graphiter` that when run, will configure your hosts and ensure graphiter is running as a service

In order to use the module, please include it in your manifest files. 

See the example below

```puppet

# manifest.pp
node default {
	class { 'graphiter': }
}

modules
â””â”€â”€ graphiter
    â”œâ”€â”€ Gemfile
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ Rakefile
    â”œâ”€â”€ files
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ cpu_lat.bt
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ graphiter.rb
    â”œâ”€â”€ manifests
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ init.pp
    â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.json
    â””â”€â”€ templates
        â”œâ”€â”€ graphiter.service.epp
        â””â”€â”€ graphiter.sh.epp

```

Either run this with your Puppet Master or if you wish to run it locally, try

```bash
puppet apply --modulepath modules/ manifest.pp

```

**Example Output:**

```bash
root@ip-172-31-29-191:/opt/pippet# puppet apply --modulepath modules/ manifest.pp

```


## Ansible
Graphiter includes an Ansible role you can easily include in existing Ansible based deployments/configurations. Included in the repo is a playbook that utilises the role.

The role will configure your hosts appropriately and ensure `graphiter` is running as a service


To run the playbook which in turn runs the role, try the following (Requires ansible to be installed)

```bash
ansible-playbook deploy_graphiter.yml -i inventory.txt --user <HOST Username> --key-file <HOST KEY LOCATION>
```


```bash 
Ansible
â”œâ”€â”€ deploy_graphiter.yml 
â”œâ”€â”€ graphiter-role
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ defaults
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ main.yml
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ files
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ graphiter.rb
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ meta
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ tasks
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ main.yml
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ templates
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ graphiter.service.j2
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ graphiter.sh.j2
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ test
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ integration
â”‚Â Â          â””â”€â”€ ubuntu
â”‚Â Â              â””â”€â”€ default.yml
â””â”€â”€ inventory.txt

```

```

## Chef
Graphiter includes a Chef cookbook you can easily include in existing Chef based deployments/configurations. Included in the repo is a kitchen.ci file that utilises the cookbook.

The cookbook will configure your hosts appropriately and ensure `graphiter` is running as a service


To run kitchen.ci which will run the cookbook, try the following (Requires ChefDK to be installed and the kitchen-ssh gem)
```bash
kitchen converge
``

# Extra Fun Findings:

During the course of development, I was assigned a test server to use to demonstrate that Graphiter worked as expected. Through some inital digging, I was able to determine a few things.


### The Instance is an EC2 Server

* By simplying running `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data` I was quickly able to confirm that the server being run in AWS as an EC2 Instance. The Instance in question had an instance-id of `i-0c3a8c6d8341b1334`

* Digging into the instance meta data, I was also able to determine the instance AMI is `ami-0306570396793d9ae` which I believe is a custom AMI as a quick search on Images in eu-west-1 (Ireland) or eu-west-2 (London) for Public images returned no results.

* The instance lives in an account `589549358292`. This is achieved by first calling `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/identity-credentials/ec2/security-credentials/ec2-instance/` which will return some temporary credentials identitfying the EC2 Instance. I can then take these creds and create a profile with the AWS CLI (first needed to install it with pip) by running `aws configure`. Once setup, I ran `aws sts get-calling-identity` which returns some basic information about who I am to AWS with said creds. Which shows me the role and account number being used.

Whilst digging around the server, I was able to find some authorised keys enabled on the server. I found this at `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

With the output, I noticed appended at the end of each key was a user and host name of where the keys originated. The list showed me names that I could then search in Google "FreeAgent \<name>", this took me to the meet the team page which I was then able to use to figure out who was who. 

Amongst the keys was a name "packer", this validated my theory that this is a custom AMI as if it has been built with Packer, the key seems to have been left over from a Packer build. 

I also spotted a name "Thomas" but I wasn't able to find him on the team page.
